1. Download the file ACR.zip (The release build can be seen in the right)

2. Unpack it anywhere

3. Run ACR.exe

4. Select one the games in the drop-down list. (Currently available are as follows: DOTA, PUBG)

5. Press "Scan"

This app doesn't scan your system memory, because games' paths are simply retrieved via Steam folder which can be found by Registry (through Steam path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam value of "SteamPath" and then we go to \steamapps\common\ ... )

The app doesn't modify/read any game's or app's (Steam's) memory, so it will never get you banned.

Keep in mind that once the files removed, they cannot be restored. Do not save any sensitive or important data in the content's folder.
